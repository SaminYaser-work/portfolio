## Project Overview
The system will be made as a Windows Form Application with .NET Framework. The
system consists of a collection of forms which passes necessary data to each other to work in
harmony. System also fetched data from the internet periodically or at the will of the user. So
a stable internet connection is required to operate this application successfully. The proposed
system will only work on Windows operating system.
The application will save necessary data for example, email, name, password in the
database as well as the preferences of the user like settings, custom news sources, favourite
links etc.
To get the updated news, the system will utilize RSS technology. In detail, the
application will download the XML file that a news service provides and parse it properly to
get the title, publication date, summary, associated images etc. and display it to the user via a
GUI application in a meaningful and intuitive way.
